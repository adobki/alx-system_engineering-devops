Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means being comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack. A way to easily assess this is to simply ask an engineer to explain how a software system works. They can have a general overview of the flow or can choose to dig deep in a certain area.

This project aimed to practice this by exploring the infrastructure side (network, servers, security…) of the question. The files in this project contain links that point to resources that pertain to my own answer.

### Mandatory Tasks
> ___0-blog_post:___ "What happens when. . ." is a classic and still widely used interview question for many types of software engineering position.
